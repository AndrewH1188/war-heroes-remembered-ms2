# War Heroes Remembered

This website has been designed to help people learn about some of the sacrifices our heroes of World War One made for us all. I have specifically decided to focus on World War One as this was supposed to be the Great War (although there was nothing great about it), the War to end all Wars, but also because I was able to uncover some of my familyâ€™s history with a couple of our relatives that went and played their part, like many other families relatives. I want to use my relatives as a starting point and look at others who played their part and list them, although as there are so many it is unfortunately impossible for me to be able to collate all the images and data alone, hence why I have selected a few Heroes as you will see on my site.

I have also created this site to keep the names and memories alive as well as to show the age ranges that took part and were lost in battle. We owe it to these people who fought for our freedoms not only to keep their names alive, but also remember the cost of war. As is inevitable each year we are losing more and more veterans and the history they have to offer and teach us. I am hoping that by providing a bit of the history as small as it is this as mentioned above helps their sacrifices live on and their memories continue, so we never forget.

A deployed live version of my War Heroes Remembered website can be found [here](https://andrewh1188.github.io/war-heroes-remembered-ms2/)

This domain link will allow you to access my live deployed website for my War Heroes Remembered as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer Milestone 2 Project assessment.

My website has been designed to be responsive across all platforms. The original design had this in mind as well as to be simple, clean, effective and appealing whilst also with the nature of such a sensitive subject be respectful.

## User Experience UX 

This website has been designed by myself Andrew Harding because of my interest in military history, as well as in finding out relatives that made the ultimate sacrifice by playing their part in the First World War. I hope that in using this website the users are able to learn about some of the selected heroes that took part as well as potentially trace someone who may be their relative or even someone who crossed paths or was in the same unit as their relative(s).

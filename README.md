# War Heroes Remembered

This website has been designed to help people learn about some of the sacrifices our heroes of World War One made for us all. I have specifically decided to focus on World War One as this was supposed to be the Great War (although there was nothing great about it), the War to end all Wars, but also because I was able to uncover some of my family’s history with a couple of our relatives that went and played their part, like many other families relatives. I want to use my relatives as a starting point and look at others who played their part and list them, although as there are so many it is unfortunately impossible for me to be able to collate all the images and data alone, hence why I have selected a few Heroes as you will see on my site.

I have also created this site to keep the names and memories alive as well as to show the age ranges that took part and were lost in battle. We owe it to these people who fought for our freedoms not only to keep their names alive, but also remember the cost of war. As is inevitable each year we are losing more and more veterans and the history they have to offer and teach us. I am hoping that by providing a bit of the history as small as it is this as mentioned above helps their sacrifices live on and their memories continue, so we never forget.

## Showcase

A deployed live version of my War Heroes Remembered website can be found [here](https://andrewh1188.github.io/war-heroes-remembered-ms2/)

This domain link will allow you to access my live deployed website for my War Heroes Remembered as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer Milestone 2 Project assessment.

My website has been designed to be responsive across all platforms. The original design had this in mind as well as to be simple, clean, effective and appealing whilst also with the nature of such a sensitive subject be respectful.

## User Experience UX 

This website has been designed by myself Andrew Harding because of my interest in military history, as well as in finding out relatives that made the ultimate sacrifice by playing their part in the First World War. I hope that in using this website the users are able to learn about some of the selected heroes that took part as well as potentially trace someone who may be their relative or even someone who crossed paths or was in the same unit as their relative(s).





































## Deployment:
In order to create this website I used GitPod to write the code, upload and store images and all relevant files that were required for this website to function, as well as show the testing, bugs, a live version of the deployed site which have been added to my README file to showcase these. With GitPod is linked to GitHub when I wrote my code I was able to use the terminal in GitPod to add, commit and push the code and any changes to their server. My project has been deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which has allowed my site to go live for people to use and view. This is another part of my expanding portfolio that employers are able to view and see my coding skills and also my design skills. Having this site live also enables me to be able to look back at my journey over the course of studying with the Code Institute and see how far I have come on my journey from my first website [Go Tennis System](https://andrewh1188.github.io/go-tennis-ms1/) to becoming a Full Stack Web Developer. Having a live deployed site enables users to view my site without having to fork or clone this for themselves, but if users would rater clone my site for themselves I have added a section below to walk them through how to do this.

The below are the following steps I took to deploy my website and make this live:

1. Click on the Repositories tab in GitHub.
2. Click on the go-tennis-ms1 link which is at the top of my repositories. This is here as it is the most recent file I have been working on. 
3. Click the settings tab.
4. Scroll all the way down near the bottom to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which now has its own dedicated tab.
5. Click the Check it out, which will take you to GitHub Pages.
6. Where it says Source, click the dropdown and set this to master.
7. Click save and then wait a few minutes before clicking on the link to view your live masterpiece.

You are more than welcome to run this project locally yourself, and if you would like to do this you will need to do the following:
1. Click on war-heroes-remembered-ms2 link which is at the top of my Repository in GitHub.
2. Click on the dropdown arrow where it says Code.
3. Click Clone, Open GitHub Desktop or Download ZIP.
4. Open in your preferred IDE.
5. Run on your preferred server.

## Content:
I have written the content for the welcome, about and the contact page as well as the headings/titles for the articles that follow.
Due to the nature of the site I have had to rely on external sources to find names, dates, images and other contributing factors for each of the War Heroes on the Heroes page.
The following outlines and shows the information that was gathered to complete the task for each Hero as well as the links that this information came from, be it partially or fully and have been listed in order as they appear on the page:

## Acknowledgments 
Firstly again for all the help and expertise given to me to make this site possible I would like to Thank enormously Antonija Simic, my absolutely wonderful and superb mentor for all the help, support and guidance that she has given to me for this Milestone Project. Again like my first Milestone project, I wouldn’t have been able to have done and completed this website without the honest feedback that I have received so thank you Antonija again for everything, I really appreciate your help and look forward to working with you again for another spectacular Milestone project.

A special thank you goes out to my superb Mum, she has listened to me talk about this project and what I am looking to try and achieve. She has suggested how I can refine/fine-tune this in order to make this project realistic, able to construct and complete. I would like to thank my Mum for her ongoing support, faith, interest and encouragement that has helped me through another Milestone Project, even if she doesn't understand the coding process, but is still proud of all the hours, dedication, hard work and immense learning that I have undertaken to get this far.

My Aunt and Uncle deserve some thanks and recognition for their interest, ongoing support and encouragement. I would like to also thank my Uncle specifically for his help in helping me better understand parts of JavaScript, although I’m sure he feels the same about the help I have given to him to better understand this as well.

Again I have my ace friend and tennis coach (in that order) Adam Jameel to thank for his support, encouragement and enthusiasm now he knows what I do (Milestone 1 Go Tennis System) although still doesn’t have a clue how the magic happens, but he believes and encourages it to do so. Thank you sir, it is great to have your support, encouragement and belief in me keeping me going, so thank you again.

Another returning thank you goes out to Jim Jenner and his wife Susie Jenner for all their encouragement, support and interest even though they don’t understand what exactly it is that I do, but nevertheless are there for me and are proud of me.

Another recurring Thank you goes out to Stuart Crang at The Learning People Global. I discussed this and the other ideas for future Milestone Projects with him, he was excited, enthusiastic and supportive as always. I would also like to thank The Learning People Global who have also checked in to see how I am getting on and offer support as well as remind me they are also there for me supporting me.

I would also like to thank the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) for putting together the template in GitPod which I was able to use along with the Emmett abbreviation. I would also like to say Thank you for the superb course content that has enabled me to learn new skills, in doing so this has enabled me to complete my second Milestone Project (which came around quickly). Also, the Student Care team for their check-up calls to see if all is ok. I really appreciate this and it really helps to remind me that there is an enormous amount of support that is there pushing me for every success. I would also like to mention and thank Alexander in Student Care for his help and support with this and answering the questions that I had regarding this project, as well as for sending through some extra resources in the way of videos to help me. It is very much appreciated and I thank you again for your help.

Another huge thank you goes out to all those who have shared the information about the Heroes listed as this helped me to add text and images (where available) to each of the 16 that played their part and cut short their lives for us. Without your help I wouldn’t have had anything to be able to work with, so thank you again.

But of course last but not least a huge thank you also goes out to all those that served to give us our freedom and democracy. I just wish I could add all of you to this site as you all deserve to be included on here, every last one of you, as well as add Heroes from the Second World War, but unfortunately, I only have a small amount of time to complete this project in. You’re all heroes and thank you all for the sacrifices you have made so we can have our tomorrow, because you gave your today. At the going down of the sun, and in the morning. We will remember them.

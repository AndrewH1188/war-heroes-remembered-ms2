# War Heroes Remembered

This website has been designed to help people learn about some of the sacrifices our heroes of World War One made for us all. I have specifically decided to focus on World War One as this was supposed to be the Great War (although there was nothing great about it), the War to end all Wars, but also because I was able to uncover some of my family’s history with a couple of our relatives that went and played their part, like many other families relatives. I want to use my relatives as a starting point and look at others who played their part and list them, although as there are so many it is unfortunately impossible for me to be able to collate all the images and data alone, hence why I have selected a few Heroes as you will see on my site.

I have also created this site to keep the names and memories alive as well as to show the age ranges that took part and were lost in battle. We owe it to these people who fought for our freedoms not only to keep their names alive, but also remember the cost of war. As is inevitable each year we are losing more and more veterans and the history they have to offer and teach us. I am hoping that by providing a bit of the history as small as it is this as mentioned above helps their sacrifices live on and their memories continue, so we never forget.

## Showcase

A deployed live version of my War Heroes Remembered website can be found [here](https://andrewh1188.github.io/war-heroes-remembered-ms2/)

This domain link will allow you to access my live deployed website for my War Heroes Remembered as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer Milestone 2 Project assessment.

My website has been designed to be responsive across all platforms. The original design had this in mind as well as to be simple, clean, effective and appealing whilst also with the nature of such a sensitive subject be respectful.

## User Experience UX 

This website has been designed by myself Andrew Harding because of my interest in military history, as well as in finding out relatives that made the ultimate sacrifice by playing their part in the First World War. I hope that in using this website the users are able to learn about some of the selected heroes that took part as well as potentially trace someone who may be their relative or even someone who crossed paths or was in the same unit as their relative(s).


## User stories 
* I would like the new/first time user to achieve their goals when visiting my website, I would expect my users to be historians and those interested in tracing their own war hero(es) using this site. 
* I would like those using my website to gain an understanding of the history that we have to offer them and hope this sparks their curiosity to want to go on and learn further by being a returning user and expanding their knowledge on a subject that interests them.
* I would like the new user or first time user to understand the reason this page has been created, as well as to learn a bit more about the Heroes listed that took part in World War One.
* As a new user or first time user I would like them to understand that there are many other Heroes that also played their part in World War One (of which I’m sure they will) and that unfortunately it simply wasn’t possible to list all of them as mentioned in the Welcome section on my home / about page.
* I would like my users to take full advantage of the interactive elements that have been specifically placed in order to help them better navigate and use my website. I’m sure if the user is anything like me they will take full advantage of these.
* I would like users to be able to discover the various age ranges of the heroes that took part and have a desire to be able to go on further to learn more.
* I would like to use the memorials and cemeteries locations on the map to be able to paint a picture of those that were in the area at the time and see just how many heroes are remembered/buried in different locations from the country where they were originally born and grew up in.


#### As a first time user I would expect the questions asked would be:
* What does this site have to offer me?
* Is the content relevant to what I am looking for?
* Does this site achieve my aim of what I am looking for?
* Does this site inform me enough to encourage me to want to learn more and do my own research into my relatives?
* Why should I use this website over any of the many other websites?
* Is this something that because of the design, layout, interaction and cleanliness of the site I will be returning to?
* Is the information that I am viewing/reading accurate?
* Is the information as up to date as it can possibly be?
* Is the information enough, too little or too much?


#### Returning Visitor Goals 
* As a returning user/visitor I would like to see updated content with more Heroes added.
* I would like the same level of clarity, information and clean layout as there is currently.
* With more Heroes added I would like to see more locations added to the map so that I can visit these.
* I would like to see more information regarding locations of where the heroes are remembered/buried added to this site.
* I would like to be able to trace and find any other heroes that may have been in the same unit(s), location or fought alongside with at the same time as my relative. 


#### As a returning user I would expect the questions asked would be:
* Is the information helpful to me and what I am looking to achieve and how I would like to achieve this?
* Have the Heroes section been added too?
* Has the website been updated and refreshed with new content, information or pages?
* Has the map been updated with the new locations?
* Has a section been added for information on the locations?
* Is the information that is currently there and the new information still of interest to me?
* Am I able to achieve my goals and needs?
* Am I able to learn more about the events before, during and after the War regarding the Heroes that were fortunate to return?


#### Frequent User Goals
* Again as mentioned in the returning user goals, I would like to see more content with more heroes added.
* I would like to see more locations that relate to the heroes that have been added.
* I would like to be able to get involved with this website and contribute towards it to help build it.


#### As a frequent user I would expect the questions asked would be:
* Is there a way in which I can contribute towards this site in the way of adding more heroes?
* If there is a way that I can get involved and contribute how can I do this?
* Is the site being maintained, looked after, updated and constantly improved so that users like me are able to keep using this website and the interactive features?


#### User Goals
The user goals that I would like War Heroes Remembered to provide to the user are:
* To be able to find out the necessary information quickly, reliably and easily. This is what will keep users focused, and also returning for more.
* There is the ability to find out about the heroes listed as well as the location of the memorials/cemeteries in which the heroes are remembered or are buried on the contact page at the top. 
* With the map showcasing the memorial/cemeteries the user is able to see where the heroes are buried/remembered from anywhere in the world. In doing so this allows them to plan a visit or holiday.
* With the added social media, this increases the user interaction and allows them to be able to continue their journey as well as upload other heroes and text for future updates to my website.
* There is the ability other than social media for users to also make contact/interact with us by filling in their name, email and their enquiry or message.













































## Deployment:
In order to create this website I used GitPod to write the code, upload and store images and all relevant files that were required for this website to function, as well as show the testing, bugs, a live version of the deployed site which have been added to my README file to showcase these. With GitPod is linked to GitHub when I wrote my code I was able to use the terminal in GitPod to add, commit and push the code and any changes to their server. My project has been deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which has allowed my site to go live for people to use and view. This is another part of my expanding portfolio that employers are able to view and see my coding skills and also my design skills. Having this site live also enables me to be able to look back at my journey over the course of studying with the Code Institute and see how far I have come on my journey from my first website [Go Tennis System](https://andrewh1188.github.io/go-tennis-ms1/) to becoming a Full Stack Web Developer. Having a live deployed site enables users to view my site without having to fork or clone this for themselves, but if users would rater clone my site for themselves I have added a section below to walk them through how to do this.

The below are the following steps I took to deploy my website and make this live:

1. Click on the Repositories tab in GitHub.
2. Click on the go-tennis-ms1 link which is at the top of my repositories. This is here as it is the most recent file I have been working on. 
3. Click the settings tab.
4. Scroll all the way down near the bottom to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which now has its own dedicated tab.
5. Click the Check it out, which will take you to GitHub Pages.
6. Where it says Source, click the dropdown and set this to master.
7. Click save and then wait a few minutes before clicking on the link to view your live masterpiece.

You are more than welcome to run this project locally yourself, and if you would like to do this you will need to do the following:
1. Click on war-heroes-remembered-ms2 link which is at the top of my Repository in GitHub.
2. Click on the dropdown arrow where it says Code.
3. Click Clone, Open GitHub Desktop or Download ZIP.
4. Open in your preferred IDE.
5. Run on your preferred server.

* [Material Design for Bootstrap (MDB) v5 & v4](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/extended/back-to-top/) I used MDB to enable me to add a back to the top for all pages, this was to make my website more user-friendly as well as provide interaction to and for the user.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) has enabled me to add the nav bar and the contact form name and email section which are responsive across all devices.


## Content:
I have written the content for the welcome, about and the contact page as well as the headings/titles for the articles that follow.
Due to the nature of the site I have had to rely on external sources to find names, dates, images and other contributing factors for each of the War Heroes on the Heroes page.
The following outlines and shows the information that was gathered to complete the task for each Hero as well as the links that this information came from, be it partially or fully and have been listed in order as they appear on the page:

I used many online sources that I found in order to give as much information about those that I am including on my website, but not only this but to also confirm that the information that I obtained is as up to date and as correct as possible. I have checked through all links and these all link to the correct sources of the information I am looking for.

#### Memorial Location coordinates:

All of the coordinates that I have added to my JavaScript Map file have been found using [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/). The name of the memorial or cemetery was searched for in the search box of Google Maps. In order to get the coordinates of the locations, I right-clicked the pin on the cemetery or memorial and this showed me at the top the coordinates for these. I listed the name, link and coordinates in a [TextEdit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextEdit) file and then loaded the coordinates and names into the locations of my JavaScript Map file. I have made this easier for myself by adding the names of the memorials or cemeteries as commented out text above the latitude and longitude coordinates to remind me as well as make this clear to another developer should they wish to fork or clone my website.

## Acknowledgments 
Firstly again for all the help and expertise given to me to make this site possible I would like to Thank enormously Antonija Simic, my absolutely wonderful and superb mentor for all the help, support and guidance that she has given to me for this Milestone Project. Again like my first Milestone project, I wouldn’t have been able to have done and completed this website without the honest feedback that I have received so thank you Antonija again for everything, I really appreciate your help and look forward to working with you again for another spectacular Milestone project.

A special thank you goes out to my superb Mum, she has listened to me talk about this project and what I am looking to try and achieve. She has suggested how I can refine/fine-tune this in order to make this project realistic, able to construct and complete. I would like to thank my Mum for her ongoing support, faith, interest and encouragement that has helped me through another Milestone Project, even if she doesn't understand the coding process, but is still proud of all the hours, dedication, hard work and immense learning that I have undertaken to get this far.

My Aunt and Uncle deserve some thanks and recognition for their interest, ongoing support and encouragement. I would like to also thank my Uncle specifically for his help in helping me better understand parts of JavaScript, although I’m sure he feels the same about the help I have given to him to better understand this as well.

Again I have my ace friend and tennis coach (in that order) Adam Jameel to thank for his support, encouragement and enthusiasm now he knows what I do (Milestone 1 Go Tennis System) although still doesn’t have a clue how the magic happens, but he believes and encourages it to do so. Thank you sir, it is great to have your support, encouragement and belief in me keeping me going, so thank you again.

Another returning thank you goes out to Jim Jenner and his wife Susie Jenner for all their encouragement, support and interest even though they don’t understand what exactly it is that I do, but nevertheless are there for me and are proud of me.

Another recurring Thank you goes out to Stuart Crang at The Learning People Global. I discussed this and the other ideas for future Milestone Projects with him, he was excited, enthusiastic and supportive as always. I would also like to thank The Learning People Global who have also checked in to see how I am getting on and offer support as well as remind me they are also there for me supporting me.

I would also like to thank the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) for putting together the template in GitPod which I was able to use along with the Emmett abbreviation. I would also like to say Thank you for the superb course content that has enabled me to learn new skills, in doing so this has enabled me to complete my second Milestone Project (which came around quickly). Also, the Student Care team for their check-up calls to see if all is ok. I really appreciate this and it really helps to remind me that there is an enormous amount of support that is there pushing me for every success. I would also like to mention and thank Alexander in Student Care for his help and support with this and answering the questions that I had regarding this project, as well as for sending through some extra resources in the way of videos to help me. It is very much appreciated and I thank you again for your help.

Another huge thank you goes out to all those who have shared the information about the Heroes listed as this helped me to add text and images (where available) to each of the 16 that played their part and cut short their lives for us. Without your help I wouldn’t have had anything to be able to work with, so thank you again.

But of course last but not least a huge thank you also goes out to all those that served to give us our freedom and democracy. I just wish I could add all of you to this site as you all deserve to be included on here, every last one of you, as well as add Heroes from the Second World War, but unfortunately, I only have a small amount of time to complete this project in. You’re all heroes and thank you all for the sacrifices you have made so we can have our tomorrow, because you gave your today. At the going down of the sun, and in the morning. We will remember them.

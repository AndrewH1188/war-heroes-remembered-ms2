# War Heroes Remembered

This website has been designed to help people learn about some of the sacrifices our heroes of World War One made for us all. I have specifically decided to focus on World War One as this was supposed to be the Great War (although there was nothing great about it), the War to end all Wars, but also because I was able to uncover some of my family’s history with a couple of our relatives that went and played their part, like many other families relatives. I want to use my relatives as a starting point and look at others who played their part and list them, although as there are so many it is unfortunately impossible for me to be able to collate all the images and data alone, hence why I have selected a few Heroes as you will see on my site.

I have also created this site to keep the names and memories alive as well as to show the age ranges that took part and were lost in battle. We owe it to these people who fought for our freedoms not only to keep their names alive, but also remember the cost of war. As is inevitable each year we are losing more and more veterans and the history they have to offer and teach us. I am hoping that by providing a bit of the history as small as it is this as mentioned above helps their sacrifices live on and their memories continue, so we never forget.

A deployed live version of my War Heroes Remembered website can be found [here](https://andrewh1188.github.io/war-heroes-remembered-ms2/)

This domain link will allow you to access my live deployed website for my War Heroes Remembered as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer Milestone 2 Project assessment.

My website has been designed to be responsive across all platforms. The original design had this in mind as well as to be simple, clean, effective and appealing whilst also with the nature of such a sensitive subject be respectful.

## User Experience UX 

This website has been designed by myself Andrew Harding because of my interest in military history, as well as in finding out relatives that made the ultimate sacrifice by playing their part in the First World War. I hope that in using this website the users are able to learn about some of the selected heroes that took part as well as potentially trace someone who may be their relative or even someone who crossed paths or was in the same unit as their relative(s).


## User stories 
* I would like the new/first time user to achieve their goals when visiting my website, I would expect my users to be historians and those interested in tracing their own war hero(es) using this site. 
* I would like those using my website to gain an understanding of the history that we have to offer them and hope this sparks their curiosity to want to go on and learn further by being a returning user and expanding their knowledge on a subject that interests them.
* I would like the new user or first time user to understand the reason this page has been created, as well as to learn a bit more about the Heroes listed that took part in World War One.
* As a new user or first time user I would like them to understand that there are many other Heroes that also played their part in World War One (of which I’m sure they will) and that unfortunately it simply wasn’t possible to list all of them as mentioned in the Welcome section on my home / about page.
* I would like my users to take full advantage of the interactive elements that have been specifically placed in order to help them better navigate and use my website. I’m sure if the user is anything like me they will take full advantage of these.
* I would like users to be able to discover the various age ranges of the heroes that took part and have a desire to be able to go on further to learn more.
* I would like to use the memorials and cemeteries locations on the map to be able to paint a picture of those that were in the area at the time and see just how many heroes are remembered/buried in different locations from the country where they were originally born and grew up in.


#### As a first time user I would expect the questions asked would be:
* What does this site have to offer me?
* Is the content relevant to what I am looking for?
* Does this site achieve my aim of what I am looking for?
* Does this site inform me enough to encourage me to want to learn more and do my own research into my relatives?
* Why should I use this website over any of the many other websites?
* Is this something that because of the design, layout, interaction and cleanliness of the site I will be returning to?
* Is the information that I am viewing/reading accurate?
* Is the information as up to date as it can possibly be?
* Is the information enough, too little or too much?


#### Returning Visitor Goals 
* As a returning user/visitor I would like to see updated content with more Heroes added.
* I would like the same level of clarity, information and clean layout as there is currently.
* With more Heroes added I would like to see more locations added to the map so that I can visit these.
* I would like to see more information regarding locations of where the heroes are remembered/buried added to this site.
* I would like to be able to trace and find any other heroes that may have been in the same unit(s), location or fought alongside with at the same time as my relative. 


#### As a returning user I would expect the questions asked would be:
* Is the information helpful to me and what I am looking to achieve and how I would like to achieve this?
* Have the Heroes section been added too?
* Has the website been updated and refreshed with new content, information or pages?
* Has the map been updated with the new locations?
* Has a section been added for information on the locations?
* Is the information that is currently there and the new information still of interest to me?
* Am I able to achieve my goals and needs?
* Am I able to learn more about the events before, during and after the War regarding the Heroes that were fortunate to return?


#### Frequent User Goals
* Again as mentioned in the returning user goals, I would like to see more content with more heroes added.
* I would like to see more locations that relate to the heroes that have been added.
* I would like to be able to get involved with this website and contribute towards it to help build it.


#### As a frequent user I would expect the questions asked would be:
* Is there a way in which I can contribute towards this site in the way of adding more heroes?
* If there is a way that I can get involved and contribute how can I do this?
* Is the site being maintained, looked after, updated and constantly improved so that users like me are able to keep using this website and the interactive features?


#### User Goals
The user goals that I would like War Heroes Remembered to provide to the user are:
* To be able to find out the necessary information quickly, reliably and easily. This is what will keep users focused, and also returning for more.
* There is the ability to find out about the heroes listed as well as the location of the memorials/cemeteries in which the heroes are remembered or are buried on the contact page at the top. 
* With the map showcasing the memorial/cemeteries the user is able to see where the heroes are buried/remembered from anywhere in the world. In doing so this allows them to plan a visit or holiday.
* With the added social media, this increases the user interaction and allows them to be able to continue their journey as well as upload other heroes and text for future updates to my website.
* There is the ability other than social media for users to also make contact/interact with us by filling in their name, email and their enquiry or message.


#### Site Goals 
The site goals that I want to achieve from creating this website are:
* I would like to be able to reach out to people that may be interested in finding out about the past in relation to World War One but with a focus in a sense less on the bigger picture but more on the people that played their part. In doing so this makes the site more personal and I feel a connection with my website and the content as a visitor/user.
* In having the ability to find heroes that are buried at the cemeteries or remembered on memorials listed on the map. In doing so I would like and hope that users will visit these locations to pay their respects to those that went out and made the ultimate sacrifice.
* I would like visitors/users to engage with the interactive features as well as make the most of the social media pages and accounts that I have set up for this project.
* I would like visitors/users to be able to take something from my site and the aims of my site which is about learning all about the different heroes that have been listed.


#### Strategy
When planning the site I was originally going to call this A Heroes Story, Heroes Stories, Stories of Heroes but decided that although these names contribute to the site content and what it was to be about that I had in mind, telling the stories of heroes would not be a strong enough title and telling the stories of heroes would not be as easy as I first thought as there are so many that there is very little known about them. Also with this in mind I had to refine the site and as they say keep it simple. This lead me to come up with the name War Heroes Remembered. With this name in place I was able to set the grounds for what I wanted the project to be about, what I required, the design and layout that I wanted to produce and see as the final finished website.


#### Scope
With the layout of my website designed as I have done, I wanted to achieve the easy effective clean look and feel, whilst also making the HTML and CSS quick to go through, this is so that I would be able to get stuck in with the JavaScript sections that I added to incorporate the interactivity of the visitor/user of my website.

Having the simple effective deign and layout I want my users to be able to obtain and learn the information as quickly as possible, without having to go searching all over my website.


#### Structure
I have structured the information/content on the relevant pages to allow the user/visitor obtain this easily and efficiently. This allows my website to be fully functional in terms of user-friendly and reliability that the user will be able to obtain the relevant information according to page title and content on this page.


#### Skeleton
Like the Structure plane all information will be grouped on the relevant pages under the relevant links and titles on the page. The information will be represented with icons for the social media platforms (that feature across all pages) as well as text and appropriate images for the content/text this is referring to or relating to. There will be images included that relate to the theme of the site of remembrance like poppies, crosses, graves and memorials. The user will be able to use the links in the nav bar to get from one page to another efficiently and effectively.


#### Surface
The finished product will look respectable and clean. This is so that the users/visitors can see and get the feel of the site and its aims, whilst also remembering the users will be able to learn and interact. I have chosen a font from [Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/) called [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=popp) that I think is clean and complements the feel of the site that I am after showcasing to the users/viewers of my site. Dark colours such as black and red have been added to keep in with the element of remembering and also complement each other as well as a light stone colour to offset the both of these. The colours of the light stone and dark red have been taken from the images and helps tie everything neatly together aiding the clean design, look and feel of my finished website.


## Design
This site has been designed over four pages and has links in the nav bar for four pages which are Home, About, Heroes and Contact Us. There is an extra Heroes page which isn’t featured in the nav bar links, this is because I wanted to add a toggler to the bottom of the Heroes page, this is so that when the user reaches the bottom of the Heroes page 1 they are able to continue their journey and read about Heroes featured on page2. I hope that by doing this I can increase the user interaction of my page as well as inform the user a bit more about the extra Heroes that I have researched.

Incorporated int the Home page is the About section down near the bottom in order to add extra content to the Home page, this and to give the user a feel for the page and why they should continue with it and what they can expect. 

The Heroes page as mentioned above features a second page of Heroes that is accessed from the first page. This is to add interaction and get the user engaging with the page a bit more, but also to enable them to keep discovering and learning along their journey throughout the page.

The Contact Us page features the map at the top of the page and this allows the user to search for the heroes listed on the page grave sites or where they are remembered / commemorated on a memorial. By adding this it also allows for more interaction from the user as well as allowing them to potentially visit the site / location of the Hero listed. Also on the Contact Us page the user has the ability to message / contact at the bottom of the page. This has been linked to EmailJS which is linked to my email account that I have specifically set up to allow me to receive emails / messages that the user has sent. 

Throughout the site using [Material Design for Bootstrap MDB](https://mdbootstrap.com/) there is the ability on whatever device the user is viewing my website on to be able to go back to the top of the page with a button that appears when they scroll down. As mentioned this has been done using [Material Design for Bootstrap MDB](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/extended/back-to-top/).

The designs original and amended can be found using the links below:

* [Instruction Page](/workspace/war-heroes-remembered-ms2/assets/images/designs/whr-instruction-page.jpg)

The font that has been used throughout my site is called Poppins as this is a nice clean font and I think complements the nature of the design and what the site is about. I have used the same font throughout my site in order to keep consistency, a clean look and tie all the pages in the way of design and feel together.

I have chosen the following colours:
* #d31216 - red - which has been used for hovered links.
* #fff - white - links and text in the black nav and footer bars.
* #ceb7a5 - a stone like colour - which has been used to show active links.
* black - which has been used for the nav bar and footer.

All colours have been used as they complement the look and feel of the page as well as each other. I selected the red and the stone colour from the images using the Adobe InDesign colour picker. I used Adobe InDesign in order to make a mock up of my final web page. In doing this it allows me to see a bit better than the wire frames how the final outcome will closely match my [Adobe InDesign](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/indesign.html) final file. Also this gives the user / another developer the ability to see the static designed version and compare this to my live version.

In my original design I added a basic [Instruction Page](/workspace/war-heroes-remembered-ms2/assets/images/designs/whr-instruction-page.jpg) which has allowed me to refer to this for the colours that were used so that I can not only add them above in my README.md file, but also onto the site itself. In this file there are the icons and the links from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) which has helped and sped up the construction of my website.


## Imagery
* I designed the Favicon in [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/illustrator.html) then exported this as a jpg in order to add this into the images folder without any issues. I created the Favicon as a larger size than the usual that is required as this makes the resolution when displayed in the browser view higher resolution than the normal favicon size which appears pixilated. 
* The great image used as the Hero image on the home page had to change from the one on my initial design because I couldn’t find where I originally downloaded this from, so couldn’t credit the person that took this photograph. I found the new and very similar image on [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/uk/) that I am able to credit.

 * file #: 231816455
 * Photo uploaded to Adobe Stock by Vince
I selected this as the Hero image for the Home page (index.html) as it is a strong, complementary, respectful image to use as the remembrance wall has many poppies in to the fallen heroes. This image is complemented by the choice of colours that I have used.
2. [Graveyard with monument in Normandy](https://pixy.org/search.php?search=Graveyard+with+monument+in+Normandy)
This is the image that I have used on the home page (index.html) above the About Us (index.htm#aboutl) section. I have used this image to section off the about us section and also as it is in keeping with the theme of the site and what this is about which is remembering as well as learning about our War Heroes.

## Wireframes
The wireframes that I have produced for War Heroes Remembered can be located [here](/workspace/war-heroes-remembered-ms2/assets/images/designs/wireframes). I wanted to keep the various pages to be simple, clean and relay the information clearly as a user would expect.
I have created very basic wireframes using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) and have as you have read above produced a more finalised version in [Adobe InDesign](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/indesign.html). Using the Balsamiq app allowed me to do the rough layout before a more finalised version was produced in Adobe InDesign and then coded into GitPod.
With keeping the layout clean and simple it will also allow me to focus on the JavaScript functions for the various pages. 
* Home / index (which encompasses the about section) wireframes can be found [here](/workspace/war-heroes-remembered-ms2/assets/images/designs/wireframes/whr-wireframes-home.png)
* Heroes original wireframes can be found [here](/workspace/war-heroes-remembered-ms2/assets/images/designs/wireframes/whr-wireframes-heroes-original.png)
* Contact Us (which encompasses the maps section to find your hero) wireframes can be found [here](/workspace/war-heroes-remembered-ms2/assets/images/designs/wireframes/whr-wireframes-contact.png)
### Changes to wireframes
Since the original wireframe designs were completed and after my first Mentoring Session, I decided to add a bit more JavaScript by adding a toggler to the bottom of the Heroes page so that this goes onto a second page with the same layout, but different Heroes. This is just to add a bit more interactivity to this page. 
* The changed Heroes wireframes can be found [here](/workspace/war-heroes-remembered-ms2/assets/images/designs/wireframes/whr-heroes1-wireframes.png) and [here](/workspace/war-heroes-remembered-ms2/assets/images/designs/wireframes/whr-heroes2-wireframes.png).
All other wireframes have remained the same and this has allowed me to be able to advance with the site to the building and testing stages, as well as to document my results in this very README file.


## Features
In this section I will briefly highlight some of the features that my website contains, why I have added these as well as the future developments, improvements or additional information or images that I would like to do in order to keep content relevant, attract new users / visitors and keep existing users / visitors returning. I believe in doing this I will be able to take this website and make it a site users are happy to return to and want to return to.
* All pages are similar in layout and are visually appealing and clean to view and enables the user to find the content that the user is looking at or looking for.
* Like my Go Tennis System Milestone 1 Project I have again incorporated the About Us into the home page at the bottom. This is to give the user a clear idea of what it is I am trying to achieve with my website, and why they should continue further with their journey on my page. The about section can easily be accessed in my nav bar as there is a link that takes you down to this section.
* In the nav bar I’ve enabled the War Heroes Remembered name to be clicked on as a link to easily take the user/visitor back to the home page of my website making this user-friendly.
* The nav bar allows you to quickly jump to the selected page that has been clicked by the user/visitor. This also shows the active link as well as allowing the user to see this is a link as when hovered over the link goes a different colour. This is again to give the user/visitor a better user experience.
* The nav bar collapses to the hamburger or as font awesome call it bars icon. This allows the users to be able to navigate on any small sized device like a phone or tablet they are using.
* The back to the top has been added in to enable the user to have a better user experience on all pages, this is particularly handy when it comes to smaller devices, but should also be made use of on larger screens like I do when I test and view my website.
* The maps section allows users to see where the locations of the heroes are as remembered or buried.
* The contact form is there for users to interact and get in touch. This has been specifically linked to my Gmail address that I created for this project and enable the users’ messages to receive a more personal reply rather than coming from a no reply email or one that may potentially auto spam itself in the users junk folder.
* This website is responsive across all viewports and is able to work on all devices, although there maybe some devices that have restrictions where JavaScript comes into play, although I shouldn’t have thought that would be the case in this day and age.
* Elements are interactive to engage the users to visit and interact with these.
* Included for the users of my website is another way of interacting and staying informed via the icons at the bottom in the footer, these take you directly to my social media platforms and allow the users to also get in contact, stay informed as well as provide some more interaction. Users interacting with my social media platforms are also able to upload photos and add text of other Heroes they would like to see on both my website and social media and are therefore contributing to the success or making sure we remember as many War Heroes as possible. By contributing to the social media platforms this allows a speedy way of being able to get more information and data quickly to enable more uploads to my website, but this also helps give the user a sense of contributing and being part of my website / community / family. This enables the user to participate and have their actions appreciated and acknowledged.


### Existing features
* The user / visitor is able to fill in their name and email on the contact form. The details that the user submits are sent to my [Google Gmail](https://www.google.com/gmail/) email address and this will allow me to be able to respond to their messages or enquiries.
* With the design and layout most items are able to fit nicely when viewed on smaller screen devices. This has been achieved because of the way the site has been designed and with some elements using Media Queries to assist.
* All links have the dark red hover colour to show users these are active working links.
* The Facebook, Twitter and Instagram icons all link to the accounts/pages that I have specifically set up on the different social media platforms to that link to War Heroes Remembered. The only exception is the YouTube icon which links to the main YouTube page, as there isn’t an account/page set up on here for War Heroes Remembered.
* Having the social media there that links to my Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages/accounts allows the user to also interact with us here, uploading and contributing their heroes and information about them.
* My website has incorporated favicon of a poppy on a black background which displays in the viewers browser tab, this has been added to give it a more professional look and help with the finished feel of my overall site.
* The visitor/user is able to see on the map where the listed heroes are buried/remembered and this enables them to be able to visit these locations if they would like to or are able to.
* A back to the top has been added in order to further assist and help the user, especially when they are using a smaller screen device.


### Future features
* I would like to add a way in which the user can submit photos and text in order to help add more War Heroes to this site and make the lists of those that fought grow. This would not only allow everyone to hopefully be included and remembered, but inclusive of all countries that helped fight for freedom and all heroes that helped secure this.
* I would like to be able to add more heroes onto this site and expand it further. To achieve this I would need to research more about other heroes and load these into my website in the same style and layout as is currently displaying.
* With the new additions I would like to add new categories, in order not only to separate the heroes into years that they were killed, but the countries they were from in order to keep everything neat, tidy and easy to find for the user.
* To help the user potentially find a relative of theirs as the site grows I would like to add a search bar at the top so the user can search the site easily, without the need to have to search each page manually.
* Where the need for more than one page occurs have the heroes span over multiple pages.
* On the pages where records go over more than 1 page when the user clicks the number at the bottom have the page automatically scroll to the top of the new page that they have clicked on.
* I would like to not only focus on the unfortunate people that didn’t return but also those that did as they are all heroes as well.
* I would like to branch from World War One into World War Two but would need to separate this in the menu bar with a new link, then from there like the additions to the World War One section categorise this into the relevant sections, based on where they fought, and if they were the fortunate ones to live to tell the tale of the horrors they unfortunately witnessed.
* Branching out and mentioning sections I would like to have for example Battle of Tannenberg, Battle Of Cambrai (1917), German Spring Offensives On The Western Front (1918), Battle Of The Somme (1916) which are some of the key dates/campaigns in World War One, to Operation Torch (November 1942), Siege Of Leningrad (September 1941 To January 1942), Battle Of The Atlantic (September 1939 To May 1945), Battle Of Britain (July 1940 To October 1940), Operation Barbarossa (June To December 1941) some of the key battles/campaigns of World War Two. With these sections/categories, I could put the Heroes and History in which would help people that know about their relatives and the campaigns/dates to help the user better find their Heroes easily.
* I would like to add a section with all the FAQ or Frequently Asked Questions, this is in order to again facilitate the user and give them a better experience whilst saving them time filling out the contact box and waiting for a reply to their question.
* I would like to add the ability to trace and find other heroes that were in the same unit(s), location or fought alongside with my relatives as well as the other heroes. I would like to see if they have stories or more to tell about the conditions, life, moral, etc.
* If I am able to find any photos of those that sadly I was unable to find I would like to be able to add these in to make sure that all heroes have a face to their name.


## Technologies and Languages Used:
I have been able to build this fully functioning website using the below languages, technologies, libraries, tools, programs other resources as well as have the help from Social Media as listed.


## Languages:
* [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
* [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
* [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)


## Libraries Frameworks and online resources:
* [Bootstrap 4.6.0:](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/)
 Bootstrap was used to help set the navigation bar.
* Google Chrome Dev Tools: For testing purposes and to see why elements are not working as expected. Dev tools allowed me to make changes to my code in the browser to see a live representation of the website with the changes / amends that have been made.
* Lighthouse: Was used for testing website performance, check for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and Search Engine Optimization (SEO). I have tested as before on my Go Tennis System the different categories mentioned above on both mobile applications and computer applications and have loaded the screenshots of the results in the testing section.
* [Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/) Google Fonts was used to find a suitable font as well as to import this font into my website. The font that I decided to use as it was clean, stylish and fitting is called Poppins which is displayed on all pages on my website / throughout the project. This is to keep styles consistent throughout my website. 
* [Font Awesome:](https://fontawesome.com/) I have used fewer icons this time as I didn’t think that too many were appropriate given the subject of the site. The Font Awesome Icons that I have used have been listed below:
 * [Hamburger Bars icon](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/bars?style=solid)
 * [Facebook icon](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/facebook-f?style=brands)
 * [Twitter icon](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/twitter?style=brands)
 * [Instagram icon](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/instagram?style=brands)
 * [YouTube icon](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/youtube?style=brands)
 * [Arrow Up icon](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/arrow-up?style=solid)
 * [Send icon](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/paper-plane?style=regular)
* [W3C HTML-validator:](https://validator.w3.org/) used to find errors in my HTML code as well as implement the suggestions to fix these.
* [Jigsaw:](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) used to find errors in my CSS code as well as implement the suggestions to fix these.
* [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) for my JavaScript to see if there are any errors and use the feedback to fix these.
* [Tiny PNG](https://tinypng.com/) Again my friend Tiny PNG was used to compress the file size of all images without losing any of the original image quality or distorting the images in any way. This is so that when the pages are loaded the images do not slow down the loading speed and therefore make this user-friendly, as well as reduces the bounce rate of users viewing and clicking off the pages.
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps) I used the Google Maps API in order to add a map to my contact page with the markers and clusters in the areas that required these.
* [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) I used EmailJS in order to hook up my contact section to my email in order to receive feedback, questions or submissions from the viewers that have interacted with my site.
* [Material Design for Bootstrap MDB](https://mdbootstrap.com/) was used for [scroll back to top](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/extended/back-to-top/) to enable the user to effortlessly scroll back up to the top of the page without having to do this the long way.


## Tools:
* [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) was used to write my code as well as paste in code from Bootstrap. In GitPod I was also able to amend the code from Bootstrap as well as create and style code in both HTML and CSS. I was able to add images to the folders that I created, as well as files to contain the code. In GitPod I was also able to (using python3 -m http.server) view my web page in the browser in a separate tab, allowing me to use the inspect section in Google to inspect elements and see what worked, as well as what didn’t work and amend this accordingly.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) Git was used for version control having set up the GitPod Terminal to commit and push saved changes and commits to GitHub.
* [GitHub:](https://github.com/) GitHub was used to store the saved changes from my project after being pushed from Git.
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)was used to deploy my website and make this live for all to explore and use.
* [Balsamiq:](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create the initial [wireframes](assets/images/designs/wireframes) and amend them to reflect the new feature(s).


## Programmes:
* [Adobe InDesign](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/indesign.html) Adobe InDesign was used to create the design mock up of the site using colours, images, setting the text and layout. I used Adobe InDesign to do this so that I had something that I could use as a final and a visual as to how the final would look. I exported the final design as an Adobe Acrobat PDF and as a jpg. I have used the jpg format as there was an error/problem with the PDF showing/displaying in GitPod when I loaded this and the Wireframes that were created in Balsamiq and also exported to Adobe Acrobat PDF
* [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/illustrator.html) Adobe Illustrator was used to create the poppy favicon and export this to a jpg so that this could be loaded into GitPod and display in the tab next to the War Heroes Remembered document name.
* [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop.html) Adobe Photoshop was used to scale the Hero images as well as the photos of the Heroes, or ones that were used if the Heroes didn’t have a photo of the Hero.


## Other Resources:
* [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check for any HTML errors and use the feedback to resolve / fix these. 
* [W3 Css Validator(https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check for any CSS errors and use the feedback to resolve /fix these. 
* [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) for my JavaScript to see if there are any errors and use the feedback to fix these.
* [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) and the learning that I have completed so far with them. This has enabled me to put together and complete my project.
* [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) I have re visited video tutorials that the Code Institute have provided regarding the different JavaScript sections. The main video tutorials were with Rosie’s Resume and adding the JavaScript elements with regard to the map and EmailJS to help me through the setup and getting mine fully functional.
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) I have used Stack Overflow in order to search for answers to my questions like why I keep getting an error with the JavaScript regarding the initMap in the console. I have looked to see if there are any suggestions on how to resolve this and other JavaScript areas that may be experiencing errors.
* [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) was used for the screenshot of the mock up which is at the top in my README.md file and also to show off my site my different social media platforms. 
* [Google Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) was used to test sizes, check responsiveness and view the layouts as well as debug errors and problems I encountered along the way.
* [Prettier.io](https://prettier.io/) was used to make my CSS look neat, tidy and easier to follow / read.
* [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) was used for checking the spelling and grammar for the content of my website.
* [Onlinespellcheck.com](https://www.online-spellcheck.com/) I have run my README.md through here to check for any spelling or grammar errors.


### Social Media:
I set up a group on [Facebook](https://en-gb.facebook.com/) called [War Heroes Remembered](https://www.facebook.com/groups/911836479678983/) so that the Facebook icon in the footer had somewhere to link too. I also set up a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) page [@war_remembered](https://twitter.com/WarRememembered) as well as an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/) page [war_heroes_remembered](https://www.instagram.com/war_heroes_remembered/) so that these icons had somewhere to link too. I wouldn’t have thought nor believed that where would be many people following or liking the content that is currently on my Instagram page, but as there are people every day following and liking my content and page I have decided that I will continue to work on this after my Milestone Project submission and after I have finished the course adding content as I am grateful for the support that I have been receiving on a daily basis. With the icon for YouTube I have left this linking to the home page of [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) as I haven’t set up an account and don’t have any videos, although there is nothing stopping me from doing this in future as part of this project going forwards in the future. 









































## Deployment:
In order to create this website I used GitPod to write the code, upload and store images and all relevant files that were required for this website to function, as well as show the testing, bugs, a live version of the deployed site which have been added to my README file to showcase these. With GitPod is linked to GitHub when I wrote my code I was able to use the terminal in GitPod to add, commit and push the code and any changes to their server. My project has been deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which has allowed my site to go live for people to use and view. This is another part of my expanding portfolio that employers are able to view and see my coding skills and also my design skills. Having this site live also enables me to be able to look back at my journey over the course of studying with the Code Institute and see how far I have come on my journey from my first website [Go Tennis System](https://andrewh1188.github.io/go-tennis-ms1/) to becoming a Full Stack Web Developer. Having a live deployed site enables users to view my site without having to fork or clone this for themselves, but if users would rater clone my site for themselves I have added a section below to walk them through how to do this.

The below are the following steps I took to deploy my website and make this live:

1. Click on the Repositories tab in GitHub.
2. Click on the go-tennis-ms1 link which is at the top of my repositories. This is here as it is the most recent file I have been working on. 
3. Click the settings tab.
4. Scroll all the way down near the bottom to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which now has its own dedicated tab.
5. Click the Check it out, which will take you to GitHub Pages.
6. Where it says Source, click the dropdown and set this to master.
7. Click save and then wait a few minutes before clicking on the link to view your live masterpiece.

You are more than welcome to run this project locally yourself, and if you would like to do this you will need to do the following:
1. Click on war-heroes-remembered-ms2 link which is at the top of my Repository in GitHub.
2. Click on the dropdown arrow where it says Code.
3. Click Clone, Open GitHub Desktop or Download ZIP.
4. Open in your preferred IDE.
5. Run on your preferred server.

* [Material Design for Bootstrap (MDB) v5 & v4](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/extended/back-to-top/) I used MDB to enable me to add a back to the top for all pages, this was to make my website more user-friendly as well as provide interaction to and for the user.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) has enabled me to add the nav bar and the contact form name and email section which are responsive across all devices.


## Content:
I have written the content for the welcome, about and the contact page as well as the headings/titles for the articles that follow.
Due to the nature of the site I have had to rely on external sources to find names, dates, images and other contributing factors for each of the War Heroes on the Heroes page.
The following outlines and shows the information that was gathered to complete the task for each Hero as well as the links that this information came from, be it partially or fully and have been listed in order as they appear on the page:

I used many online sources that I found in order to give as much information about those that I am including on my website, but not only this but to also confirm that the information that I obtained is as up to date and as correct as possible. I have checked through all links and these all link to the correct sources of the information I am looking for.

#### Memorial Location coordinates:

All of the coordinates that I have added to my JavaScript Map file have been found using [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/). The name of the memorial or cemetery was searched for in the search box of Google Maps. In order to get the coordinates of the locations, I right-clicked the pin on the cemetery or memorial and this showed me at the top the coordinates for these. I listed the name, link and coordinates in a [TextEdit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextEdit) file and then loaded the coordinates and names into the locations of my JavaScript Map file. I have made this easier for myself by adding the names of the memorials or cemeteries as commented out text above the latitude and longitude coordinates to remind me as well as make this clear to another developer should they wish to fork or clone my website.

* I have made every effort to attribute the work of others and credit them where possible. I would like to thank all the sources that are available for being able to not only find my relatives and the information but the relatives of others and information relating to them so their names may live forevermore and their sacrifices known.


## Acknowledgments 
Firstly again for all the help and expertise given to me to make this site possible I would like to Thank enormously Antonija Simic, my absolutely wonderful and superb mentor for all the help, support and guidance that she has given to me for this Milestone Project. Again like my first Milestone project, I wouldn’t have been able to have done and completed this website without the honest feedback that I have received so thank you Antonija again for everything, I really appreciate your help and look forward to working with you again for another spectacular Milestone project.

A special thank you goes out to my superb Mum, she has listened to me talk about this project and what I am looking to try and achieve. She has suggested how I can refine/fine-tune this in order to make this project realistic, able to construct and complete. I would like to thank my Mum for her ongoing support, faith, interest and encouragement that has helped me through another Milestone Project, even if she doesn't understand the coding process, but is still proud of all the hours, dedication, hard work and immense learning that I have undertaken to get this far.

My Aunt and Uncle deserve some thanks and recognition for their interest, ongoing support and encouragement. I would like to also thank my Uncle specifically for his help in helping me better understand parts of JavaScript, although I’m sure he feels the same about the help I have given to him to better understand this as well.

Again I have my ace friend and tennis coach (in that order) Adam Jameel to thank for his support, encouragement and enthusiasm now he knows what I do (Milestone 1 Go Tennis System) although still doesn’t have a clue how the magic happens, but he believes and encourages it to do so. Thank you sir, it is great to have your support, encouragement and belief in me keeping me going, so thank you again.

Another returning thank you goes out to Jim Jenner and his wife Susie Jenner for all their encouragement, support and interest even though they don’t understand what exactly it is that I do, but nevertheless are there for me and are proud of me.

Another recurring Thank you goes out to Stuart Crang at The Learning People Global. I discussed this and the other ideas for future Milestone Projects with him, he was excited, enthusiastic and supportive as always. I would also like to thank The Learning People Global who have also checked in to see how I am getting on and offer support as well as remind me they are also there for me supporting me.

I would also like to thank the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) for putting together the template in GitPod which I was able to use along with the Emmett abbreviation. I would also like to say Thank you for the superb course content that has enabled me to learn new skills, in doing so this has enabled me to complete my second Milestone Project (which came around quickly). Also, the Student Care team for their check-up calls to see if all is ok. I really appreciate this and it really helps to remind me that there is an enormous amount of support that is there pushing me for every success. I would also like to mention and thank Alexander in Student Care for his help and support with this and answering the questions that I had regarding this project, as well as for sending through some extra resources in the way of videos to help me. It is very much appreciated and I thank you again for your help.

Another huge thank you goes out to all those who have shared the information about the Heroes listed as this helped me to add text and images (where available) to each of the 16 that played their part and cut short their lives for us. Without your help I wouldn’t have had anything to be able to work with, so thank you again.

But of course last but not least a huge thank you also goes out to all those that served to give us our freedom and democracy. I just wish I could add all of you to this site as you all deserve to be included on here, every last one of you, as well as add Heroes from the Second World War, but unfortunately, I only have a small amount of time to complete this project in. You’re all heroes and thank you all for the sacrifices you have made so we can have our tomorrow, because you gave your today. At the going down of the sun, and in the morning. We will remember them.

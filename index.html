      <p class="welcome">Welcome to War Heroes Remembered,<br>where War Heroes live on</p>

<p class="welcome-article"> We are delighted to welcome you to such a special site that is able to remember just some of the many heroes that played their part in World War One. 
  <br>Of course there are so many more that we would have liked to have added that also played their part and went out to secure our freedom, and democracy for many countries all round the globe.
</p>

<p class="welcome-article">
  We would like to have been able to have featured every hero but as there are so many it is impossible to do, there are many that were unknown and this also makes the task that little bit more difficult.
</p>

<p class="welcome-article">
  We hope the selection of Heroes that we have been able to present to you give you a thirst for wanting to learn more and carry out your own research into your own family members, as well as learn about your hero and their history, 
  the role they played and where they are remembered/buried.
</p>

<section id="about">
  <p class="welcome">About Us</p>

<p class="welcome-article"> We have collected and collated data from various sources about a selection of the different heroes that all played their part in the First World War. 
  From Privates to Lance Corporals, from Second Lieutenants to the Nurses, 
  everyone who was active has a story to tell and we want to help them live on by learning about their sacrifices and remembering them.
</p>

<p class="welcome-article">
  We have provided a selection of different heroes that saw action in various locations across the globe, in life and unfortunately in death their paths crossed. 
  Many are buried in the same cemeteries or remembered in the same location as their fellow comrades that also went and played their part.
</p>

<p class="welcome-article">
  So please explore our our site and see some of the many that played their part for you, 
  and you never know our paths could cross with an unknown relative that you discover.
